# NANO Pronote Extension for Firefox
A firefox extension for the Pronote website as a student. Pronote is a service for students to access their homeworks, notes... Everything related to school

This extension allows you to get a fresh dark theme to save your eyes from a flashbang at midnight.
It also has an auto-login system to prevent you from wasting 30 secondes 400 times/day logging in.

The dark theme will also delete useless spaces as discussions and menu de la cantine.
To activate the dark theme, simply open the extension's menu and click on toggle theme.

The auto-login will, as it's name mentions, login by itself and allow you to always have pronote opened.
To activate it, simply open the extension's menu, check the auto-login field, enter your login creditentials, and click on save.
To disable it, simply uncheck the auto-login field, and click on save.
